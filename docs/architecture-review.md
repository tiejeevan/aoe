# Architecture Review & Future-Proofing Checklist

This document serves as a high-level architectural review of the Gemini Empires game engine. Its purpose is to validate our current systems against future expansion goals, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and moddability.

## Core Architectural Pillars (Current State)

Our foundation is built on a **data-driven design**. Instead of hardcoding game entities, we have established dynamic, admin-manageable systems for the three core pillars of the game:

1.  **Dynamic Resources:** The game's economy is not fixed. The admin can create, modify, and disable any number of resources (e.g., Food, Wood, Gold, Crystal, Mana). The UI and game logic adapt automatically.
2.  **Dynamic Buildings:** Buildings are defined as data, not code. The admin can configure everything from build costs and HP to upgrade paths and population capacity.
3.  **Dynamic Units:** Units are highly configurable entities with deep attributes for combat, mobility, economy, and upgrades, all managed through the admin panel.

This data-driven approach is the single most important factor for our future success.

## Future-Proofing Checklist

This checklist evaluates our readiness for planned and potential future features.

| Feature / System Area            | Status                               | Notes                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Structure Scalability**   |                                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ↳ New Resource Types             | ✅ **Ready**                         | The resource system is fully dynamic. New resources can be added via the admin panel without code changes.                                                        |
| ↳ New Unit Types & Attributes    | ✅ **Ready**                         | The `UnitConfig` is comprehensive and the admin UI supports creating entirely new units and defining their complex attributes.                                      |
| ↳ New Building Types & Categories| ✅ **Ready**                         | The `BuildingConfig` is comprehensive, and the upgrade tree system (`treeId`) allows for deep, logical hierarchies.                                               |
| **Dynamic Rules & Modifiers**    |                                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ↳ Advanced Tech Trees / Research | ⚠️ **Partial**                       | The data structures (`requiredResearchIds`, `unlocksResearchIds`) are in place, but a dedicated "Research" system/UI needs to be built to manage these technologies. |
| ↳ Environmental Effects (Weather)| ❌ **Needs Work**                    | No systems currently exist for global modifiers like weather. This would require a new "World State" manager and integration into the main game loop.             |
| ↳ Trade & Economy Systems        | ❌ **Needs Work**                    | While resources are marked as "tradable," no actual market or trade route system exists yet. This would be a major new feature.                                  |
| ↳ Diplomacy / Factions         | ❌ **Needs Work**                    | No concepts of factions or player relationships exist. This is a significant feature that would require a new "Diplomacy Engine."                                    |
| **UI Adaptability**              |                                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ↳ Dynamic Rendering of Content   | ✅ **Ready**                         | The resource header, cost displays, and admin panels are now dynamically generated based on the active resource/unit/building lists.                              |
| **System Interactivity**         |                                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ↳ Global Event-Driven System     | ⚠️ **Partial**                       | We have a system for discrete, random `GameEvent`s, but not a true event bus for communicating between systems (e.g., a research completion firing an event).        |
| **Long-Term Maintainability**    |                                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ↳ Save Game Versioning           | ❌ **Needs Work**                    | The `dbService` does not currently handle schema versioning. If we add a new mandatory field to `UnitConfig`, old saves could fail to load.                      |
| ↳ Moddability Support            | ⚠️ **Partial**                       | Our data-driven design is inherently mod-friendly. However, a formal modding API, asset injection, and script-hooking system would be required for true mod support. |
| **Performance & AI**             |                                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ↳ Late-Game Performance          | ⚠️ **Partial**                       | The game loop is currently simple. It will need optimization (e.g., spatial partitioning for collision/targeting) as unit counts increase significantly.           |
| ↳ Multi-Level AI Behaviors       | ❌ **Needs Work**                    | No unit or economic AI exists yet. This is a major area for future development, likely requiring state machines and goal-oriented action planning.                |

### Conclusion

Our current architecture is **strong and well-prepared** for the addition of new content (resources, units, buildings). The decision to adopt a data-driven model was correct and has paid dividends.

Our primary focus for future architectural work should be on:
1.  **Building a dedicated Research/Technology System.**
2.  **Implementing Save Game Versioning** to protect player progress as we evolve the data structures.
3.  **Developing the core AI systems** for units and economic management.
